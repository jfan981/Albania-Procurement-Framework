You are an expert researcher analyzing failure modes of LLMs in public procurement
corruption / integrity risk assessment.

Below are cases where the LLM's assigned risk label DOES NOT MATCH the structured
OECD-aligned rule-based model.

For each case, you are given:
- The rule-based risk level
- The LLM-predicted label
- The LLM explanation
- The full rule-based score decomposition:
  * integrity_risk
  * process_risk
  * financial_risk
  * delivery_risk
  * underlying raw signals (bids, fund usage, cancellations, etc.)
  * final risk_score

Your tasks:

1. Identify recurring LLM reasoning failures:
   - Overweighting certain signals
   - Underweighting key risk indicators
   - Misinterpreting competitive structure
   - Overreacting to fund_usage
   - Ignoring cancellation history
   - Poor multi-factor aggregation
   - Upward/Downward bias
   - Contradictory logic

2. Group the cases into named failure modes:
   - Give each mode a short descriptive name
   - Explain the reasoning flaw
   - Show 1–2 representative examples
   - Explain why the rule-based OECD model disagrees

3. Finish with a summary:
   - Systemic weaknesses of LLMs in public procurement risk reasoning
   - Risks of relying on LLMs for integrity screening
   - Why rule-based OECD scoring is more policy-grounded and reliable

Here are the mismatched cases:

    llm_explanation: The procurement process shows a healthy level of competition with 41 bids and no indication of single-bid dominance. However, the winning supplier's dominance in 2025 with 18 contract wins and a moderate historical cancellation rate of 0.11 introduce a potential risk of favoritism or dependency. The ratio of the winning bid to the limit fund being 0.83 also suggests a fair but not excessive discount.

    llm_explanation: The procurement process involved a single bidder, which can be a risk factor for reduced competition. However, the winning offer was significantly below the limit fund, indicating potential cost-effectiveness. Also, the supplier has a low historical cancellation rate and a relatively low share of wins in single-bid procedures, which might mitigate some concerns.

However, the winning supplier's extensive success with 57 contracts could indicate a potential concentration risk. Additionally, the supplier's low share of wins in single-bid procedures and historical cancellation rate are reassuring but the reduced number of qualified bids may indicate barriers to entry.

However, the high volume of contracts won by the supplier in 2025 and the large total value might indicate a dominance in the market, raising potential concerns about competition. The supplier's low single-bid win rate and zero cancellation rate mitigate some risk, but the overall circumstances suggest a medium level of concern regarding potential integrity risks.

    llm_explanation: The case exhibits several potential indicators of risk. The limit fund for this procedure is listed as 0.00, which is unusual and can point towards a lack of transparency in financial expectations. Additionally, the supplier has won a significant number of contracts within the year, suggesting possible favoritism, although their share of wins in single-bid procedures remains low. The historical cancellation rate is also minimally concerning at 3%, indicating some procedural issues but not decisively high.

    llm_explanation: There are potential integrity concerns due to the absence of a documented limit fund and a winning offer value significantly above zero. However, all five bids were qualified, and there is no indication of a single bidder scenario. The frequent winning of the supplier could suggest a competitive edge but might also hint at preferential treatment. The supplier's low share of wins in single-bid procedures and moderate historical cancellation rate contribute to a medium risk label.

However, the winning supplier's high number of recent contracts could suggest preferential treatment, though their low share in single-bid wins and a moderate cancellation rate provide some mitigation. The significant discount from the limit fund indicates possible efficiency but could also be a sign of underbidding to secure contracts.

    llm_explanation: The procurement case has several positive indicators, such as multiple bids and no single bidder dependency, which lower the risk. However, the winning supplier's extensive history of winning contracts raises concerns about potential favoritism. The low ratio of winner value to limit fund suggests competitive pricing, but the supplier's dominance in the market requires attention to ensure fairness.

    llm_explanation: The risk is elevated due to the limit fund for the procedure being set to 0.00, which heavily skews the winner_value/limit_fund ratio. However, transparency is enhanced by a competitive process with five qualified bids. The winning supplier is experienced with a low cancellation rate, but their high volume of past contracts could suggest favoritism.

    llm_explanation: The procurement case shows a healthy level of competition with 24 bids and no signs of single bidder occurrences. However, the winning supplier's dominance in previous contracts, having won 30 contracts in a single year, suggests potential over-reliance on one supplier, which can indicate a risk. While the ratio of winner value to limit fund is reasonable and the historical cancellation rate is low, the high number of prior wins by the supplier calls for further scrutiny.

    llm_explanation: The presence of multiple bids and the fact that six were qualified indicates a competitive process, which is positive. However, the winning supplier's dominance in the market, having won 59 contracts in a single year, suggests potential undue influence or dependency. Additionally, a historical cancellation rate of 0.15 might indicate some performance issues, elevating the risk to medium.

LLM OUTPUT:

    llm_explanation: The procurement process involved a fair level of competition with 7 bids submitted, indicating a potentially competitive environment. However, the contracting authority's limit fund for the procedure being 0.00, while the winning offer is significantly high, raises questions about financial clarity and budget alignment. Additionally, the winning supplier has a notable contract history, which might suggest familiarity but also poses a risk of favoritism if not properly justified. The supplier’s low cancellation rate suggests reliability, which moderates the overall risk assessment.

    llm_explanation: The absence of a limit fund suggests a lack of budgetary control, which can create opportunities for inflated pricing.

    llm_explanation: The procurement case shows that no bids were submitted, and the winning offer value is zero, suggesting a potential issue in the tender process. The absence of competition and the fact that the winning supplier has no contract history or previous winning records in 2025 further indicate significant integrity concerns.

LLM OUTPUT:
    llm_label: High
    llm_explanation: The winning offer value of 0.00, despite a limit fund of 2471628.00, suggests possible irregularities or errors. The same supplier winning multiple contracts in 2025, all with a winning offer value of 0.00, further raises concerns about potential bid manipulation or collusion. These factors indicate a high risk of integrity issues in this procurement case.

LLM OUTPUT:
    llm_label: High
    llm_explanation: The winning offer value and the total value of the supplier's contracts are both reported as 0.00, which is suspicious. This indicates potential issues in reporting or recording financial data, suggesting a high risk of integrity issues. Additionally, there is no fiscal benefit apparent for the supplier, which is unusual and warrants further investigation.

LLM OUTPUT:
    llm_label: High
    llm_explanation: The winning offer value is 0.00, which indicates a potential error or manipulation in the reporting or bidding process. Although there were multiple bids and no indication of a single qualified bidder, the zero value for the winning bid suggests possible irregularities or unreported issues. This unusual circumstance raises concerns about transparency and integrity, warranting a high-risk classification.
