{"id": 0, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a healthy level of competition with 41 bids and no indication of single-bid dominance. However, the winning supplier's dominance in 2025 with 18 contract wins and a moderate historical cancellation rate of 0.11 introduce a potential risk of favoritism or dependency. The ratio of the winning bid to the limit fund being 0.83 also suggests a fair but not excessive discount."}
{"id": 1, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value is suspiciously low at 16.00 compared to the limit fund of 208333.00, creating a highly unusual situation. Additionally, the winning supplier has a pattern of winning a significant number of contracts (59 in 2025) with a large total value, suggesting potential preferential treatment. These factors collectively indicate a high corruption risk."}
{"id": 2, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "While the contract was awarded through a competitive process with seven bids and a strong ratio of winner value to limit fund, the winning supplier's high number of total contracts in a single year suggests market dominance. However, the supplier's low cancellation rate and lack of wins in single-bid procedures reduce the perception of malpractice."}
{"id": 3, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents a medium risk level based on several factors. Although the competition appears fair with 24 bids and 12 qualified, the winning supplier's frequent contract wins (9 in 2025 alone) and a moderate historical cancellation rate (0.11) suggest potential concerns. The proximity of the winning bid to the limit fund without single-bid dominance adds complexity to the risk assessment."}
{"id": 4, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a competitive bidding process with 6 bids submitted and 2 qualified bidders, indicating a healthy level of competition. The winning bid was significantly lower than the limit fund, and there is no indication of any single-bid or single qualified bidder issues. The supplier has a good performance record with no historical cancellations and no reliance on single-bid wins, minimizing integrity risks."}
{"id": 5, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a competitive environment with 26 bids submitted and multiple qualified bids, reducing single-bidder and qualification risks. However, the winning supplier has a high historical cancellation rate of 0.48, which might indicate issues in delivery or contract execution. Although the supplier has a low share of wins in single-bid procedures, the cancellation history necessitates caution, raising the overall risk to medium."}
{"id": 6, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case shows a significant anomaly as there is a winning offer value of 0.00 with no bids submitted or qualified. This suggests a lack of competition or potential manipulation. Such discrepancies in procurement processes, particularly with a complete absence of bids, indicate a high risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 7, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning bid value is 0.00, which is an irregularity that suggests potential corruption or procedural errors. Additionally, the absence of any submitted or qualified bids raises concerns about the integrity and competitiveness of the procurement process. These factors indicate a high risk of corruption."}
{"id": 8, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive given the 19 bids submitted and 15 qualified bids. The winner's bid is significantly below the limit fund, indicating cost efficiency. The supplier has minimal involvement in single-bid procedures and a low contract cancellation rate, suggesting a low risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 9, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows that no bids were submitted, and the winning offer value is zero, suggesting a potential issue in the tender process. The absence of competition and the fact that the winning supplier has no contract history or previous winning records in 2025 further indicate significant integrity concerns."}
{"id": 10, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process showed competitive bidding with 17 bids and 14 qualified, indicating a fair level of competition. However, the winning supplier's high contract win rate and historical cancellation rate of 0.24 could indicate potential risks. Although the winning bid was significantly lower than the limit fund, these other factors suggest medium risk."}
{"id": 11, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value is reported as 0.00, which is unusually low and indicates potential procedural errors or fraudulent reporting. Despite 12 bids being submitted, no monetary offer was documented as winning. Additionally, the winning supplier has won multiple contracts without any recorded monetary value. These anomalies suggest a high risk of corruption or integrity issues in the procurement process."}
{"id": 12, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a healthy level of competition with 44 bids submitted and 19 of them qualified, indicating transparency and competitiveness. The winning bid is significantly lower than the limit fund, suggesting cost-effectiveness. The winning supplier has a clean record with no historical cancellations and no dominance in single-bid procedures, indicating low corruption or integrity risk."}
{"id": 13, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value being 0.00 and the ratio of winner value to limit fund being 0.00 indicate potential irregularities in the procurement process. Additionally, only one bidder was qualified despite four bids, raising concerns about competitive fairness. The winning supplier having a history of winning seven contracts valued at 0.00 also suggests unusual patterns that could point to high corruption or integrity risks."}
{"id": 14, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents some potential risk factors. The winning supplier has a high number of past wins, which could indicate favoritism or undue influence. However, the ratio of the winning offer to the limit fund and a relatively low historical cancellation rate provide a counterbalance. Additionally, the absence of single-bid procedures reduces suspicion of collusive behavior. These mixed indicators suggest a medium risk level."}
{"id": 15, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows a competitive bidding process with 28 bids submitted and no single-bidder flags, suggesting a healthy competition. However, the winning supplier's significant number of contracts won and relatively high historical contract value may indicate a potential aggregation of power, which could introduce risk. The supplier's low cancellation rate suggests reliability, mitigating some risk concerns."}
{"id": 16, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows several positive indicators: a competitive bidding environment with 10 bids submitted and no single bidder or single qualified bidder flags. However, the winning supplier's frequent success, having won 57 contracts in a year, and the relatively high ratio of their wins may indicate a medium risk of preferential treatment. The supplier's low historical cancellation rate is a positive, though it does not fully mitigate the potential risk factors."}
{"id": 17, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement procedure indicates significant issues as there were no bids submitted and the winning offer value is 0.00. This suggests a lack of competition, which is a strong indicator of potential integrity risk. Furthermore, the details provided about the winning supplier's history do not align with a typical competitive procurement process, leading to a high corruption risk classification."}
{"id": 18, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents a high corruption risk due to several concerning factors: the winning offer value is 0.00, no bids were submitted, and no qualified bidders participated. Additionally, the winning supplier does not have a history of winning contracts in the year considered. These anomalies suggest a potential lack of transparency and competitiveness, which can indicate underlying integrity issues in the procurement process."}
{"id": 19, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The key concern is the winning offer value being 0.00, which is anomalous and suggests a potential issue in the tendering process. Despite multiple bids being submitted, the absence of a monetary value raises red flags about the legitimacy and transparency of the procurement. This, coupled with the supplier's substantial share of wins in single-bid procedures, suggests a high risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 20, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process exhibits a low corruption risk. There is a healthy competition with 9 bids submitted and 3 qualified bidders. The winning bid's value is close to the limit fund at 0.96, indicating competitive pricing. The winning supplier has a history of zero cancellations and no wins in single-bid procedures, suggesting integrity and competitiveness in their bidding."}
{"id": 21, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with 11 bids submitted and a reasonable ratio of winning offer value to limit fund (0.78). The winning supplier has a clean history with no single-bid wins or cancellations. These factors indicate a low corruption risk."}
{"id": 22, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a competitive environment with 6 bids submitted and 3 qualified, indicating healthy competition. The winning bid's value is close to the limit fund, suggesting fair pricing. Furthermore, the supplier has no history of winning single-bid contracts or cancellations, which reduces the risk of favoritism or poor performance. Therefore, the overall corruption risk is low."}
{"id": 23, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a competitive environment with 5 qualified bids and no indicators of single bidder concerns. However, the winning supplier's dominance in the market with 28 contracts won in 2025 and a high total contract value suggests a concentration of awards. While their share of wins in single-bid procedures and historical cancellation rate are low, the supplier's market dominance creates a medium risk of potential favoritism or lack of diversification."}
{"id": 24, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a medium corruption risk due to several factors. Although there was a competitive bidding environment with 26 bids and no single-bidder issues, the winning supplier has a significant number of contracts, which could suggest preferential treatment or a dominance in the market. Additionally, their historical cancellation rate of 0.11 could indicate potential issues in fulfilling contract obligations."}
{"id": 25, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows some positive signs of competition, with 21 bids submitted and 20 qualified. The winning bid is significantly lower than the limit fund (ratio of 0.69), indicating cost-effectiveness. However, the winning supplier's high success rate in recent contracts (19 wins) could suggest potential familiarity or favoritism, although their low share in single-bid wins (0.05) and cancellation rate (0.05) mitigate these concerns, placing this at a medium overall risk."}
{"id": 26, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a healthy level of competition with 15 bids submitted and 14 qualified. The winning bid is close to the limit fund at 0.90 ratio, suggesting competitive pricing. The winning supplier has no history of winning through single-bid procedures or cancellations, which indicates transparency and integrity in their procurement engagements."}
{"id": 27, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contracting process shows low corruption indicators, such as a 0% single-bid procedure and 18 total bids, with 16 qualified. However, the frequent winning of contracts by one supplier who has a 10% contract cancellation rate raises some concerns about the supplier's consistency and possible dominant market position."}
{"id": 28, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement's integrity risk is moderate due to the high number of contracts awarded to the winning supplier, indicating potential preferential treatment, despite competitive bidding with 20 bids and no single bidder flags. The supplier's historical cancellation rate is low, which slightly mitigates risk concerns."}
{"id": 29, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive, with 11 bids submitted and 7 qualified. There is no evidence of single bidding, and the ratio of the winning offer to the limit fund is within a reasonable range at 0.96. Additionally, the winning supplier has a low historical cancellation rate, and no indication of irregularities in past contract awards."}
{"id": 30, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a competitive environment with 38 bids and no indication of single bidding, suggesting transparency. However, the winning supplier's history of winning 74 contracts in a year and a historical cancellation rate of 0.19 introduces concerns about possible reliability or over-reliance on one supplier. These factors together point to a medium risk."}
{"id": 31, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract has a relatively high number of competing bids and a moderate winner to fund ratio, suggesting competitive pricing. However, the winning supplier's high number of contracts in the same year raises concerns about potential preferential treatment or improper market dominance. The supplier's low single-bid win share and moderate historical cancellation rate indicate some governance issues, contributing to a medium risk classification."}
{"id": 32, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procedure was competitive with 20 bids submitted and 9 qualified, indicating a healthy level of competition. The winning offer was 85% of the limit fund, which suggests cost-effectiveness without underbidding. Additionally, the winning supplier has a low historical cancellation rate and no dominance in single-bid wins, further reducing integrity concerns."}
{"id": 33, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a reasonably competitive environment with 12 bids and no single bidder dominance. However, the winning supplier's high number of recent contracts could suggest preferential treatment, though their low share in single-bid wins and a moderate cancellation rate provide some mitigation. The significant discount from the limit fund indicates possible efficiency but could also be a sign of underbidding to secure contracts."}
{"id": 34, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a healthy level of competition with 24 bids and no signs of single bidder occurrences. However, the winning supplier's dominance in previous contracts, having won 30 contracts in a single year, suggests potential over-reliance on one supplier, which can indicate a risk. While the ratio of winner value to limit fund is reasonable and the historical cancellation rate is low, the high number of prior wins by the supplier calls for further scrutiny."}
{"id": 35, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer was significantly below the limit fund, which suggests competitive pricing. With 38 bids submitted and 36 qualified, there is strong competition. However, the winning supplier has a significant contract win history in 2025, indicating potential market domination, though with no single-bid wins and a low cancellation rate. The balance of factors suggests a medium risk profile."}
{"id": 36, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The risk appears to be low because there were 16 bids submitted and 6 qualified, indicating competitive interest. The winning offer is very close to the limit fund, suggesting market pricing. Moreover, the supplier has no history of cancellations and a share of 0.00 in single-bid wins, which further indicates competitive procurement and reliable performance."}
{"id": 37, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with 24 bids submitted and 17 qualified, reducing risks of collusion. The winning bid is slightly below the limit fund, indicating cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the winning supplier has no history of cancellations and does not rely on single-bid wins, suggesting reliability and fair competition."}
{"id": 38, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "Although there were no red flags related to single bidding or high cancellation rates, the high number of contracts won by the supplier in a short period suggests a potential risk of favoritism or market dominance. The low ratio of winning offer to limit fund indicates cost efficiency, but the overall pattern warrants closer scrutiny."}
{"id": 39, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The presence of multiple bids and the fact that six were qualified indicates a competitive process, which is positive. However, the winning supplier's dominance in the market, having won 59 contracts in a single year, suggests potential undue influence or dependency. Additionally, a historical cancellation rate of 0.15 might indicate some performance issues, elevating the risk to medium."}
{"id": 40, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The winning bid was significantly below the limit fund, suggesting effective competition. Six bids were submitted, and four were qualified, indicating a competitive process. No single bidder or single qualified bidder issues were present. Additionally, the winning supplier's lack of involvement in single-bid procedures and its zero historical cancellation rate further support a low integrity risk assessment."}
{"id": 41, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value of 0.00 suggests unclear or potentially misleading pricing, which raises concerns about the legitimacy of the procurement. Additionally, despite no monetary value, the winning supplier has secured 7 contracts, indicating potential non-monetary benefits or other irregularities. These factors contribute to a high-risk assessment for corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 42, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement appears competitive, with 14 bids and no single bidder or single qualified bidder issues. The winning bid's value is well below the limit fund, indicating cost-effectiveness. However, the winning supplier's high volume of contract wins in 2025 raises concerns of market dominance. Additionally, the historical cancellation rate of 20% suggests potential issues with contract performance."}
{"id": 43, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears transparent with competitive bidding, evidenced by 13 submitted bids and 2 qualified bids. However, the winning supplier has a high volume of wins in 2025, raising potential concerns about favoritism or undue influence. The procurement being under the limit fund is positive, but the supplier's successful streak warrants closer monitoring to ensure no undue advantage is being exercised."}
{"id": 44, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract price was significantly lower than the limit fund, and there was healthy competition with 25 bids submitted and 14 qualified. However, the winning supplier has been awarded a substantial number of contracts in 2025, which may suggest a concentration risk. While there's no evidence of single-bid winning, the high volume of wins by one supplier warrants attention."}
{"id": 45, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value being 0.00 is highly unusual and may indicate a data entry error or an attempt to manipulate the procurement process. Despite multiple bids, the absence of a winning offer value raises concerns about transparency and the integrity of the process. Additionally, the complete lack of historical data on the winning supplier's past contracts or wins suggests potential red flags in their reliability or capability."}
{"id": 46, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The key concern is that the winning offer value is 0.00, suggesting a potential issue with the awarding process or a clerical error. Additionally, none of the bids were qualified, which raises red flags about the competitiveness and fairness of the procurement process. The absence of a successful supplier background further contributes to a perception of heightened risk."}
{"id": 47, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement involves a large number of bids (24), promoting competitiveness. The winning offer is significantly lower than the limit fund, indicating a potentially cost-effective selection. However, the winning supplier's large share of contracts (364 in 2025) suggests market dominance, which can pose integrity risks. The supplier's low cancellation rate (0.07) and absence of single-bid dominance are positive indicators, balancing the risk to medium."}
{"id": 48, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a healthy level of competition, with 20 bids submitted and no indication of a single bidder dominating the process. However, the supplier has won a significant amount of contracts in a single year, which could indicate favoritism or lack of diversity in awarded contracts. While there is no history of cancellations or single-bid wins, the high volume of contracts from the same supplier warrants closer scrutiny."}
{"id": 49, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears to exhibit a low risk of corruption or integrity issues. There was a competitive bidding process with 19 bids submitted, and 9 were qualified, indicating healthy competition.

These factors collectively imply a low corruption or integrity risk."}
{"id": 51, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement procedure shows a healthy competition with 14 bids submitted and 10 qualified, indicating a competitive environment. The ratio of the winning offer to the limit fund is 0.76, suggesting a price well below the limit, which minimizes overspending risk. Additionally, the winning supplier has a low share of single-bid wins (0.17) and a historical cancellation rate of 0.00, showing reliability and integrity in fulfilling contracts."}
{"id": 52, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case exhibits significant red flags: the winning offer value is 0.00, and no bids were submitted or qualified. A lacking competitive process with no participants indicates a potential issue with transparency or attractiveness of the tender. These factors raise concerns about integrity and potential corruption."}
{"id": 53, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The contract appears to have been awarded following a competitive process, indicated by the 21 bids and 10 qualified ones, reducing the risk of collusion or favoritism. The winning bid was significantly below the limit fund, suggesting cost-effective procurement without apparent manipulation of the bid value. The winning supplier's extensive experience and low cancellation rate point to reliability, further mitigating corruption risk."}
{"id": 54, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows a significant number of bids (23), indicating competitive interest, and no single bidder flags are present. However, the winning supplier has a high number of contracts won in a short time span and a relatively high historical cancellation rate of 0.24, which suggests possible concerns with contract fulfillment. The substantial gap between the winning offer and the fund limit also warrants further scrutiny, hence presenting a medium risk."}
{"id": 55, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a reasonable ratio between the winning offer and the limit fund (0.89) and has competitive bidding with 2 qualified bids. However, the winning supplier's high volume of contracts (63 in a single year) and substantial total contract value raises potential concerns of market dominance. The supplier’s low share in single-bid procedures and low cancellation rate mitigate some risk, but the overall context suggests a medium risk category."}
{"id": 56, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows significant irregularities with a winning offer value of 0.00, indicating possible procedural deficiencies.

{"id": 58, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows signs of competitive bidding with no single bidder issues and all bids being qualified, which points to a relatively transparent process. However, the high volume of contracts won by the supplier in 2025 and the large total value might indicate a dominance in the market, raising potential concerns about competition. The supplier's low single-bid win rate and zero cancellation rate mitigate some risk, but the overall circumstances suggest a medium level of concern regarding potential integrity risks."}
{"id": 59, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value of 0.00, despite a limit fund of 2471628.00, suggests possible irregularities or errors. The same supplier winning multiple contracts in 2025, all with a winning offer value of 0.00, further raises concerns about potential bid manipulation or collusion. These factors indicate a high risk of integrity issues in this procurement case."}
{"id": 60, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears transparent with six bids submitted and three qualified, indicating competition. The winning offer was very close to the limit fund, which is common in competitive bids. Importantly, the single bidder and single qualified bidder flags are both zero, reducing concerns about lack of competition. Additionally, the supplier has no history of cancellations and has a low concentration of wins in single-bid scenarios, further indicating low risk of corrupt practices."}
{"id": 61, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case exhibits a low level of corruption risk. The winning offer value is significantly below the limit fund, and the procedure had multiple qualified bids. Additionally, the winning supplier shows no historical issues with cancellations and no reliance on single-bid procedures to gain contracts, suggesting healthy competition."}
{"id": 62, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows signs of competitive bidding, with 15 submitted bids and 6 qualified, which is positive. However, the winning supplier's extensive contract history and a relatively high historical cancellation rate of 0.12 suggest potential over-reliance on a single supplier. The absence of single-bid procedures mitigates risk, yet the volume of contracts awarded to this supplier warrants further scrutiny."}
{"id": 63, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows a healthy competition with no indication of single bidder dominance, as evidenced by 9 bids submitted and 5 qualified. The winning bid being significantly lower than the limit fund suggests efficiency. The supplier has a very low cancellation rate and no signs of winning through uncompetitive means, such as single-bid procedures, which further indicate low corruption risk."}
{"id": 64, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows competitive behavior with 18 bids and no single bidder flags, suggesting a fair process. However, the winning supplier's extensive success with 57 contracts could indicate a potential concentration risk. Additionally, the supplier's low share of wins in single-bid procedures and historical cancellation rate are reassuring but the reduced number of qualified bids may indicate barriers to entry."}
{"id": 65, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows a competitive process with 22 bids and no single-bidder dominance, indicating a healthy competitive environment. However, the winning supplier's high number of contracts and notable historical cancellation rate of 0.29 suggest potential over-reliance on a specific supplier and possible integrity risks. Despite the low share in single-bid procedures, the cancellation rate prompts further scrutiny."}
{"id": 66, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive, with 12 bids submitted and 4 qualified. The winning bid is significantly under the limit fund, and the supplier shows minimal participation in single-bid procedures. Although the supplier frequently wins contracts, the low cancellation rate suggests reliability."}
{"id": 67, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement exhibits a healthy level of competition with 16 bids submitted and 15 qualified. However, the winning supplier's high number of contracts in 2025 and significant total contract value could indicate a concentration of influence. The supplier's low share of wins in single-bid procedures and moderate cancellation rate mitigate some risks, leading to a medium assessment."}
{"id": 68, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with five bids and no single qualified bidder, reducing risk. However, the winning supplier's high number of contracts in a single year raises potential concerns about market dominance.

{"id": 69, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with six qualified bids, and the winning bid is significantly lower than the limit fund, suggesting fair pricing. However, the winning supplier has an extensive history of contract wins, raising potential concerns about market dominance. Despite no single-bid wins and a low cancellation rate, the frequent success could imply undue influence or preferential treatment."}
{"id": 70, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process attracted a substantial number of bids (21), and there were multiple qualified offers (13), indicating a competitive environment which typically suggests low risk. However, the winning supplier has won a significant number of contracts in the same year, which can pose a medium risk due to potential market dominance, although their performance history (low cancellation rate) does not immediately suggest integrity issues."}
{"id": 71, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The use of a 'Negotiated without Notice' procedure type poses a high risk of integrity issues, as it lacks transparency and competition. The winning offer value being 0.00 and no bids submitted further indicate irregularities. These factors suggest potential mismanagement or corruption in the procurement process."}
{"id": 72, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case involves a competitively awarded contract with a relatively low ratio of winning offer to limit fund (0.79), indicating potential financial prudence. However, the winning supplier's success in multiple high-value contracts in a single year could suggest a concentration risk. Despite the absence of single-bid flags and a history of bidding competitiveness, the repetitive wins merit closer scrutiny."}
{"id": 73, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case has several positive indicators, such as multiple bids and no single bidder dependency, which lower the risk. However, the winning supplier's extensive history of winning contracts raises concerns about potential favoritism. The low ratio of winner value to limit fund suggests competitive pricing, but the supplier's dominance in the market requires attention to ensure fairness."}
{"id": 74, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a competitive environment with 24 bids submitted, and no indication of favoritism through single-bid flags. However, the winning supplier has an unusually high number of contracts and a significant total contract value, which raises concerns about market dominance. The supplier's low share of wins in single-bid procedures and a moderate cancellation rate mitigate some risks, warranting a 'Medium' risk classification."}
{"id": 75, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with 22 bids and no single bidder dominance. However, the winning supplier has secured 47 contracts in 2025, indicating a potentially high level of market influence. Additionally, the supplier's historical cancellation rate is 0.17, which may signal potential integrity issues. These factors contribute to a medium corruption risk rating."}
{"id": 76, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "There is a relatively low ratio of the winning value to the limit fund, suggesting competitive pricing. With 32 bids received and 26 qualified, competition appears robust. However, the winning supplier has a significant contract win history, indicating potential favoritism or influence, especially given their high cancellation rate of 0.33. These factors suggest a medium risk of integrity issues."}
{"id": 77, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows several indicators of low risk: a high number of bids (44) with many being qualified (39), and the winning supplier has no single-bid wins. The win ratio of 0.50 indicates competitive pricing and the supplier's low cancellation rate of 0.06 suggests reliability. These factors collectively indicate a low corruption risk in this procurement process."}
{"id": 78, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The high winning bid ratio (0.98) suggests limited competition or potentially high pricing, indicating some risk. Although there were multiple bids, only half were qualified, and the winning supplier has a significant presence with 18 contracts in the same year, which could imply favoritism or reduced competition. However, the lack of a history for single-bid wins and no cancellations suggest stability."}
{"id": 79, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a moderate risk primarily due to the winning supplier's history of winning a large number of contracts (23) and a relatively high total value, which might indicate preferential treatment or reduced competition over time. However, the presence of multiple bids and a competitive bid value relative to the limit fund suggest a relatively fair process, further evidenced by no single-bidder scenarios."}
{"id": 80, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case presents several red flags indicating a significant integrity risk. The fact that no bids were submitted or qualified, coupled with a winning offer value of 0.00, suggests potential procedural failures or manipulations. Additionally, despite the procedure type being open and local, the complete lack of competitive offers raises concerns about transparency and fairness in the procurement process."}
{"id": 81, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a competitive bidding process with three bids submitted and more than one qualified bidder. The winning bid is close to the limit fund, indicating efficient budget utilization. The winning supplier's past contracts do not show a disproportionate win rate in single-bid scenarios, and their historical cancellation rate is zero, suggesting reliability and low integrity risks."}
{"id": 82, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows significant indicators of potential risk. Despite having 8 bids submitted, no bids were qualified, resulting in a winning offer of 0.00, which points to procedural or evaluation irregularities. Additionally, the historical data for the winning supplier indicates no prior contracts or experience, raising questions about the transparency and fairness of the process."}
{"id": 83, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive, as indicated by the number of bids (11) with 9 qualified, and a healthy winning bid compared to the limit fund ratio (0.50). The winning supplier has a low share of single-bid wins (0.02) and a moderate historical cancellation rate (0.15), suggesting fair competition and moderate reliability. These factors collectively point to a low corruption/integrity risk."}
{"id": 84, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value is reported as 0.00, which is suspicious and implies a lack of transparency or data error. Additionally, no bids were submitted, and the winning supplier, who has not won any contracts in 2025, raises concerns about the integrity of the procurement process. These factors suggest a high risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 85, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "Although there is a competitive element with five bids submitted and two qualified, the winning supplier has a significant number of contract wins in 2025, indicating potential favoritism. The ratio of the winning offer to the limit fund is relatively high at 0.91. However, there is no indication of single-bid dominance, and the supplier's low historical cancellation rate provides some assurance of performance integrity."}
{"id": 86, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value is reported as 0.00, which is highly irregular and suggests potential data entry errors or issues with transparency. Despite eight bids being submitted, the complete lack of a winning value makes the outcome suspicious. Additionally, the supplier appears to lack a track record, indicated by zero contracts won in the reference year, further heightening integrity concerns."}
{"id": 87, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with 25 bids submitted and a winning bid ratio of 0.90 of the limit fund. However, the winning supplier has been awarded a large number of contracts (35) in 2025 alone, which could indicate preferential treatment or concentration risk. Although their historical cancellation rate is low at 0.06, the significant volume of contracts might suggest medium-level integrity risks."}
{"id": 88, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement exhibits several indicators of low corruption risk: a competitive bidding process with 24 total bids and 22 qualified, a winning bid value well below the limit fund, and no flags indicating single bidder scenarios. Additionally, the supplier has a history of winning multiple contracts without single-bid procedures and a zero cancellation rate, supporting a record of reliability and proper competition."}
{"id": 89, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved a competitive environment with 21 bids submitted and multiple qualified bidders, reducing the likelihood of favoritism. The winning supplier did not have a disproportionate share in single-bid procedures and maintained a history of no canceled contracts, indicating reliable performance and low integrity risk."}
{"id": 90, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears to be competitive, with five total bids and no indication of single bidding or disqualification concerns. The winning bid is significantly below the limit fund, suggesting a fair competition. Additionally, the winning supplier has a consistent record without cancellations or dominance in single-bid contracts, indicating low risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 91, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement procedure appears competitive with 7 bids submitted and 5 qualified, indicating no single-bidder dominance. The winning bid is below the limit fund, demonstrating cost-effectiveness. The winning supplier has a low historical cancellation rate of 0.04, and their share of wins in single-bid procedures is 0.00, reducing the risk of favoritism."}
{"id": 92, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value is 0.00, which indicates a potential error or manipulation in the reporting or bidding process. Although there were multiple bids and no indication of a single qualified bidder, the zero value for the winning bid suggests possible irregularities or unreported issues. This unusual circumstance raises concerns about transparency and integrity, warranting a high-risk classification."}
{"id": 93, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "Although the procurement process appears competitive with 24 bids and no single bidder dominance, the winning supplier has a significant number of contracts in one year. The supplier's win rate in single-bid scenarios is relatively low, suggesting competitive practices. However, the large volume of contracts combined with a moderate historical cancellation rate may raise concerns about favorability or over-reliance on one supplier."}
{"id": 94, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents a low corruption risk. The winning bid value is close to the limit fund, indicating reasonable pricing. Multiple bids were submitted and two were qualified, showing competitive participation. Additionally, the winning supplier has no history of canceled contracts or dominance in single-bid procedures."}
{"id": 95, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement procedure appears competitive with 17 total bids and no single bidder flags, which suggests a fair level of competition. However, the winning supplier's frequent contract awards in 2025 and a relatively high historical cancellation rate of 0.12 raise concerns about past performance and potential favoritism, elevating the overall risk to Medium."}
{"id": 96, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a competitive bidding process, indicated by 17 bids submitted and multiple bids qualified. However, the winning supplier has a significant number of contract wins in the year, which could suggest preferential treatment or over-reliance on this supplier. Additionally, the supplier's historical cancellation rate of 0.19 raises some concerns about performance reliability."}
{"id": 97, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with 8 bids received and multiple bids qualified. The winning bid value is lower than the limit fund, reducing suspicion of overpricing. However, the winning supplier has secured a significant number of contracts in 2025, which could indicate potential for preferential treatment. The low share of wins in single-bid procedures and low cancellation rate partly mitigate the concerns."}
{"id": 98, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value and the total value of the supplier's contracts are both reported as 0.00, which is suspicious. This indicates potential issues in reporting or recording financial data, suggesting a high risk of integrity issues. Additionally, there is no fiscal benefit apparent for the supplier, which is unusual and warrants further investigation."}
{"id": 99, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "Despite a substantial number of bids and no single-bid red flags, the winning supplier has a high number of contracts with the authority, raising concerns about preferential treatment. Additionally, the supplier's cancellation rate of 0.17 suggests potential issues with contract fulfillment, further increasing the integrity risk."}
{"id": 100, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contracting process shows moderate risk factors. Although the procurement had multiple bids and a low cancellation rate for the winning supplier, the fact that only one bid was qualified raises concerns about the competitiveness and integrity of the selection process. Additionally, the winning supplier's significant history of contract awards could indicate potential favoritism."}
{"id": 101, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The presence of only one qualified bid suggests limited competition, raising potential integrity concerns, even though the overall bid ratio is reasonable at 0.83. Additionally, the winning supplier's history of winning multiple contracts in a short period could indicate potential favoritism. However, the absence of wins in single-bid procedures and a low cancellation rate mitigate some of the risk."}
{"id": 102, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows moderate risk factors. Although the winning offer closely matches the limit fund indicating competitive pricing, the winning supplier has a high contract win rate and a substantial historical cancellation rate of 0.46, which raises concerns about performance reliability. Additionally, the supplier's involvement in single-bid procedures, albeit low, could suggest limited competition or familiarity with the contracting authority."}
{"id": 103, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process had a high competition with 7 bids submitted. However, only one bid was qualified, which raises concerns about the qualification criteria. The winning supplier is very active with 42 contracts in 2025, but their low share in single-bid procedures and low cancellation rate slightly mitigate these concerns. The close ratio of the winner's value to the limit fund suggests possible price alignment."}
{"id": 104, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved a relatively high number of bids (22) and multiple qualified bidders (7), which typically indicates a competitive environment. However, the winning supplier's high volume of contracts (85) and substantial historical cancellation rate (0.47) suggest potential risks related to performance stability. The close proximity of the winning bid to the limit fund (ratio 0.98) could indicate potential preference or insider advantage."}
{"id": 105, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case presents a significant anomaly with the winning offer value being only 0.00% of the limit fund, which is extremely unusual and raises concerns about transparency and competition. Additionally, although the supplier has a low cancellation rate, their dominance in previous contract wins, especially with a notable share of single-bid successes, suggests potential collusion or favoritism, contributing to a high corruption risk."}
{"id": 106, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract was procured using a competitive process with two bids submitted, suggesting a fair level of competition. However, the winning supplier has a high share of wins in single-bid procedures (0.70), which might indicate preferential treatment or lack of competition in other instances. This factor raises a moderate concern about potential systemic issues in procurement processes, leading to a medium corruption/integrity risk assessment."}
{"id": 107, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved multiple bids, with no indication of a single bidder scenario, which is a positive indicator for competition. However, the winning supplier has a high historical contract cancellation rate of 0.38, which raises concerns about their reliability and performance integrity. Despite these concerns, the supplier's share of wins in single-bid procedures is low, suggesting limited dominance in potentially non-competitive processes."}
{"id": 108, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with 15 bids submitted and no single bidder scenario. However, the winning supplier has a high historical cancellation rate of 0.35, which raises concerns about their reliability. Additionally, the supplier's significant number of contracts in 2025 suggests a potentially high market share, which might indicate preferential treatment despite a low share in single-bid wins."}
{"id": 109, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows significant red flags: the winning offer value is recorded as 0.00, indicating potential errors or misreporting. There was only one bid submitted, and no bids were qualified, suggesting a lack of competition. The winning bidder has no previous contract wins, pointing to potential inexperience or favoritism. Overall, these factors suggest a high corruption risk."}
{"id": 110, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The ratio of the winning bid value to the limit fund is 0.95, suggesting competitive pricing. However, only one bid was qualified out of four, indicating potential issues in the qualifying criteria. The winning supplier has won three contracts in 2025, but there is no history of cancellations, which is positive. The single qualified bidder flag raises some concern about the integrity of the competition."}
{"id": 111, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The risk is medium due to a few factors: although the winning bid is significantly lower than the limit fund, which indicates potential cost-efficiency, there was only one qualified bid, suggesting limited competition. Additionally, the winning supplier has a significant history of contracts, raising potential concerns about recurring supplier dominance. However, a low cancellation rate suggests competence and reliability."}
{"id": 112, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning supplier has secured a high number of contracts within a short period, which suggests possible preferential treatment. However, the large number of bids submitted and qualified diminishes the risk associated with limited competition. Furthermore, the supplier's share in single-bid procedures is low, although the cancellation rate is slightly concerning."}
{"id": 113, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract was awarded with a close ratio of 0.98 between the winning offer and the limit fund, which may suggest limited cost savings. While three bids were submitted and no flag indicates a single bidder, the winning supplier has a high cancellation rate of 0.50, which raises concerns about reliability and performance. Additionally, although this supplier has multiple wins, none were in single-bid scenarios, mitigating some risk."}
{"id": 114, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows significant risks: the winning offer value is zero, which is highly unusual and suggests possible non-compliance or errors. Furthermore, only one bid was submitted and unqualified, indicating a lack of competition. These factors strongly suggest potential corruption or serious procedural issues."}
{"id": 115, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The discrepancy between the limit fund (1.00) and the winning offer value (161900.00) indicates a potential error or manipulation in the contract values, suggesting a high risk of corruption. Additionally, the winning supplier’s history of securing a high number of contracts may raise concerns about favoritism or a lack of competition."}
{"id": 116, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procedure had multiple bids submitted but only one was qualified, indicating a potential risk of lack of competitiveness. Additionally, the winning supplier has won 18 contracts in a single year, which could suggest preferential treatment. However, the supplier does not have a history of cancellations or winning in single-bid situations, mitigating some risks."}
{"id": 117, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The main concern is the supplier's high historical cancellation rate of 0.24, which could indicate performance or reliability issues. However, the competitive environment with 4 bids and a balanced offer close to the limit fund suggests fair competition. The absence of single-bid procedures in the supplier's history reduces the risk of favoritism. Overall, the risk is medium due to the cancellation rate."}
{"id": 118, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process has a competitive ratio with 10 bids and no single bidder situations, indicating a fair process. However, the winning supplier has a significant number of contract wins and a historical cancellation rate of 0.17, which suggests potential concerns about performance reliability. These factors contribute to a medium-level integrity risk."}
{"id": 119, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value matches exactly the limit fund, which may indicate deliberate pricing to maximize contract value. Additionally, the supplier has a history of a relatively high cancellation rate (17%), which can reflect potential reliability issues. However, the lack of single-bid flags and a fair competition with multiple qualified bids suggests some level of integrity in the procurement process."}
{"id": 120, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case involves a considerable number of bids (20), which typically indicates competitive procurement. However, the high number of contracts won by the supplier, along with a relatively significant historical cancellation rate of 0.27, suggests potential concerns about the supplier's performance reliability. Despite no single-bid or single-qualified-bid flags being present, these factors elevate the integrity risk to a medium level."}
{"id": 121, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "While the procedure was conducted openly and 3 bids were submitted, only one bid qualified, which could raise concerns about the competitive nature of the procurement. Additionally, the winning supplier has a significant number of contracts won in the same year, indicating a possible concentration of awards to a single supplier. However, the absence of a single-bid procedure and a zero historical cancellation rate reduces the overall risk."}
{"id": 122, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The risk is classified as Medium due to the high concentration of contract wins by the supplier, raising questions about competition despite no single-bid procedures. Additionally, the single qualified bidder suggests limited competition which could be a concern. However, the low ratio of winner value to limit fund and zero historical cancellation rate mitigate the risk."}
{"id": 123, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value significantly exceeds the limit fund, suggesting potential mispricing or budget misstating, which raises concerns. While the single-bidder and single qualified bidder flags are not raised, indicating competition, the winning supplier's historical performance and a high number of contract wins suggest possible favoritism. The supplier's low cancellation rate shows reliability, but the overall context warrants moderate scrutiny."}
{"id": 124, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning supplier has been awarded a significant number of contracts in 2025, which might indicate strong market presence, but the fact that only one bid was qualified suggests potential barriers to competition. The supplier's historical cancellation rate is moderate, which can point to some performance issues. While the winning bid is well below the limit fund, these factors combined suggest a medium level of corruption or integrity risk."}
{"id": 125, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a competitive environment with 20 bids and no single bidder flags, indicating low immediate procedural risk. However, the winning supplier has a high historical cancellation rate of 20%, which could suggest reliability issues. Additionally, the supplier has won a substantial number of contracts, raising potential concerns about concentrated market power."}
{"id": 126, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The substantial discrepancy between the limit fund and the winning offer value of 0.00 indicates a potential manipulation or error in reporting. Additionally, the fact that the supplier has won multiple contracts at zero value and has a significant history of wins in single-bid procedures with no cancellations suggests a possible pattern of non-competitive or collusive behavior, raising the integrity risk of this procurement to high."}
{"id": 127, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The risk is classified as Medium due to the presence of only one qualified bidder, despite three bids being submitted. Although the winning offer is close to the limit fund, indicating competitive pricing, the fact that the winning supplier has a history of securing multiple contracts might suggest possible favoritism or reduced competition. The supplier's zero cancellation rate and no single-bid procedure wins provide some assurance of integrity."}
{"id": 128, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows signs of healthy competition with no single bidder or single qualified bidder issues, and the winning offer is close to the limit fund. However, the winning supplier has a high historical cancellation rate of 0.17, which indicates potential reliability concerns. Although the supplier does not dominate single-bid procedures, the numerous contracts won in 2025 could suggest a risk of over-reliance or preferential treatment."}
{"id": 129, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract winner was the only qualified bidder, which can indicate a lack of competition and raises concerns about fairness. However, the winning supplier's share of wins in single-bid procedures and their historical cancellation rate being 0.00 suggests some level of integrity. The overall risk is mitigated by multiple bids received, although the procedure's integrity could still be questionable due to limited qualified competition."}
{"id": 130, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The single qualified bidder flag indicates limited competition, raising potential integrity concerns. The winning supplier has won multiple contracts in the same year, suggesting frequent selection, though their historical cancellation rate of 0.00 indicates reliability. The ratio of winner value to limit fund at 0.93 suggests a competitive offer, yet the limited number of qualified bids elevates the risk."}
{"id": 131, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The presence of 26 bids with only 2 qualified suggests competitive interest but potentially restrictive qualification criteria. The winning supplier's history of 15 contracts in a single year and a 13% cancellation rate are areas of concern. However, the winning bid is reasonably close to the limit fund, and the supplier's share of wins in single-bid procedures is low, indicating moderate risk."}
{"id": 132, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning supplier has a significant history of winning contracts, and a high volume of recent wins could indicate preferential treatment. While there were two bids submitted, only one was qualified, limiting competition. The supplier has a clean record regarding cancellations and single-bid procedures, which mitigates some risk, but overall, the potential for preferential treatment suggests a medium risk."}
{"id": 133, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The summary indicates a high corruption risk due to multiple red flags. The winning offer value of 0.00 suggests a possible error or manipulation. Additionally, there was only a single bidder, and the bid was not qualified, yet the procedure proceeded. Such anomalies suggest a lack of competition and oversight, raising significant integrity concerns."}
{"id": 134, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a healthy level of competition with 16 bids and 6 qualified offers, indicating low risk in terms of competitive bidding practices. However, the winning supplier's historical cancellation rate of 0.37 is relatively high, suggesting potential reliability or performance issues, which increases the integrity risk. Therefore, the overall risk is classified as Medium."}
{"id": 135, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "Despite a competitive bidding process with 35 bids submitted and 9 qualified, the winning supplier's frequent contract wins and high historical cancellation rate raise concerns. The exact match of the winning offer to the limit fund also suggests potential manipulation or insider information, warranting a medium risk assessment."}
{"id": 136, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement appears competitive with 9 bids and no single bidder issues. However, the winning supplier's history of 45 contracts suggests dominance, and a cancellation rate of 0.27 indicates potential fulfillment issues. The cost savings (12% under the limit fund) is a positive aspect, balancing potential risks."}
{"id": 137, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case presents a medium risk due to the supplier's high number of contract wins and the significant total value of these contracts, which could indicate favoritism or unfair advantage. However, multiple bids and zero single-bid wins suggest competitive procurement, lowering the risk. The supplier's historical cancellation rate at 0.14 adds some concern regarding reliability."}
{"id": 138, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with two qualified bids and a winning bid close to the limit fund. However, the high volume of contracts (125) awarded to the same supplier in a single year could indicate potential favoritism or reduced competition overall. The supplier's low share of wins in single-bid procedures (0.04) and a moderate cancellation rate (0.06) suggest acceptable past performance, but require further scrutiny given the volume of wins."}
{"id": 139, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a moderately competitive environment with 19 bids and 6 qualified ones, reducing typical collusion risks. However, the winning supplier has frequently won contracts, and despite an absence of single-bid dominance, they possess a high contract cancellation rate of 0.28. This history suggests potential reliability concerns, warranting a medium risk label."}
{"id": 140, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a winning offer value almost equal to the limit fund, which indicates potential tailoring of the bid. The winning supplier has won multiple contracts in 2025, suggesting possible favoritism, though their share in single-bid procedures is negligible. The relatively high historical cancellation rate of 0.25 also raises concerns about supplier reliability."}
{"id": 141, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "Although the procurement process appears competitive with 5 bids and no single bidder flags, the winning supplier has a relatively high historical cancellation rate of 17%. Additionally, the supplier's significant number of contracts in 2025 and the closely matched winning offer to the limit fund might indicate a manageable but present risk."}
{"id": 142, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning bid ratio to the limit fund is high at 0.97, indicating close alignment with the maximum budget. Although there were multiple bids and a non-single-bidder procedure, the supplier is a frequent winner with numerous contracts in the same year, which could indicate preferential treatment. The historical cancellation rate of 0.19 adds a moderate risk factor, suggesting repeated issues with contract completion."}
{"id": 143, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The risk is classified as Medium due to the high frequency of contract wins by the supplier, suggesting a potential over-reliance on a single supplier. Furthermore, the supplier's historical cancellation rate of 0.42 indicates issues with contract fulfillment. Despite a competitive bidding process with multiple bids and a healthy ratio between offer and limit fund, these factors raise concerns about integrity and performance consistency."}
{"id": 144, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with 15 bids submitted and 9 qualified, which suggests transparency. However, the winning supplier has a high success rate in previous contracts and an 80% win rate in single-bid procedures, indicating potential favoritism. Despite no historical cancellations, these factors elevate the risk to a medium level."}
{"id": 145, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case presents a medium risk due to the winning supplier's high number of contracts in 2025 and a relatively low cancellation rate. However, the competitive nature of the bidding process (28 bids, with 3 qualified) and no single-bidder flags reduce suspicion. The 95% bid-to-limit fund ratio, while competitive, suggests close alignment with the estimated budget, warranting further examination."}
{"id": 146, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning supplier has a large number of contracts and a relatively low cancellation rate, suggesting reliability. However, only one bid was qualified out of four, which could indicate issues with transparency or barriers for other potential suppliers. The single qualified bidder flag raises concerns about competitive fairness, leading to a medium risk assessment."}
{"id": 147, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows signs of competitive behavior with 7 bids submitted and no single bidder qualified. However, the winning supplier's history of 42 contracts in a single year suggests concentrated market dominance, raising potential integrity concerns. Additionally, the supplier's cancellation rate of 0.14 may indicate performance issues, contributing to a medium risk level."}
{"id": 148, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case has a notable number of bids submitted and qualified, indicating competitive procedures. However, the winning supplier has a high historical cancellation rate of 0.35, which suggests potential risk in contract performance. Additionally, the supplier has won a significant number of contracts in the same year, which may raise concerns about capacity and fairness in large-scale awarding."}
{"id": 149, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a winning bid very close to the limit fund, suggesting strong competition due to 14 bids being submitted. However, the winning supplier has won an unusually high number of contracts in 2025, indicating the potential for favoritism or entrenched supplier relationships. While the supplier's share of wins in single-bid procedures is low, their high volume of business and moderate cancellation rate suggest a medium level of integrity risk."}
{"id": 150, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The significant discrepancy between the limit fund (1.00) and the winning offer value (69550.00) raises major red flags, suggesting potential manipulation or errors in the procurement process. Additionally, the winning supplier's high volume of contracts (63 in one year), combined with a significant historical cancellation rate (0.17), further indicates possible systemic issues with contract execution and integrity."}
{"id": 151, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process had four bids, suggesting good initial competition, but only one was qualified, raising a concern about bid evaluation criteria. The winning supplier's high number of contracts won in 2025 may indicate preferential treatment, although their cancellation rate is zero and they have no single-bid wins, which moderates the risk."}
{"id": 152, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows competitive bidding with 21 bids submitted, and no indicators of single-bid issues, which suggests a generally open process. However, the winning supplier's contract history raises concerns: they secured 85 contracts in one year and have a high cancellation rate of 0.47, potentially indicating performance or reliability issues. These factors elevate the integrity risk to medium."}
{"id": 153, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The competitive nature of the bidding process is suggested by 17 bids submitted and qualified, which mitigates single-bid concerns. However, the high historical cancellation rate of the winning supplier (40%) poses a potential integrity risk, suggesting possible issues in contract fulfillment. Additionally, the supplier's significant number of contracts in a single year could indicate preferential treatment or over-reliance on this supplier."}
{"id": 154, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows competitive aspects with 12 bids submitted and no flags for single bidders. However, the winning supplier's high number of contracts suggests potential dominance in the market. Additionally, the historical cancellation rate of 0.24 raises concerns about reliability, contributing to a medium risk classification."}
{"id": 155, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement procedure is open with multiple bids submitted, reducing single-bid risks. However, there is a concern as only one bid was qualified, indicating potential competitive limitation. Additionally, the frequent winning of contracts by the supplier, combined with a history of some cancellations, suggests a need for closer scrutiny, although their share of single-bid wins is low, mitigating high-risk concerns."}
{"id": 156, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a fairly competitive environment, with 9 bids submitted and multiple bidders qualified. However, the winning supplier's substantial history of contract awards and moderate share of wins in single-bid procedures suggest potential preferential treatment. The low cancellation rate mitigates some risk, but the overall context suggests a medium risk level."}
{"id": 157, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "There are indicators of potential risks: the winning supplier has a high contract win rate with a substantial historical cancellation rate of 0.40, which may suggest performance issues. However, the competitive nature of the bidding with 33 bids and no reliance on single-bid or single-qualified-bid scenarios reduces some concerns, leading to a medium-risk evaluation."}
{"id": 158, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "Although the competition appears healthy with 25 bids submitted and no single bidder issues, the winning supplier has a high volume of contracts within the same year, suggesting potential favoritism or insider advantage. Additionally, the supplier's historical cancellation rate of 30% is concerning, indicating potential risk in contract fulfillment."}
{"id": 159, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The fact that only one bid was qualified out of four may indicate limited competition, which can be a risk factor, though the absence of a single-bidder situation mitigates this concern. The winning bidder's extensive history of winning contracts suggests a strong market position, but combined with the low cancellation rate, it does not immediately indicate impropriety. The bid value being close to the limit fund is typical but still warrants some scrutiny."}
{"id": 160, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract was awarded through an open procedure with a competitive offer ratio of 0.97, indicating fair competition. However, only one bid qualified, which may signal inadequate market engagement or restrictive criteria. Additionally, the supplier has won multiple contracts in a short period, warranting closer scrutiny for potential favoritism, though their zero cancellation rate suggests reliability."}
{"id": 161, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with three bids submitted and two qualified. The winning bid was close to the limit fund, indicating price competitiveness. However, the winning supplier's historical activity shows a high volume of contracts and a significant cancellation rate, which may suggest operational risks or contractual challenges, contributing to a medium risk level."}
{"id": 162, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a close match between the winning offer and the limit fund, suggesting possible precision. Although 6 bids were submitted, only 1 was qualified, raising concerns about the qualification criteria. The winning supplier's large number of prior contracts could imply an advantageous position, but with no single-bid wins and a low cancellation rate, this risk is mitigated somewhat. Overall, these factors suggest a medium risk level."}
{"id": 163, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The overall corruption risk is medium due to the presence of only one qualified bidder, which can indicate lack of competition. However, the ratio of winner value to limit fund is reasonable at 0.83, suggesting fair pricing. The supplier has a history of winning numerous contracts, but their share of wins in single-bid procedures and cancellation rate are moderate, mitigating some risk."}
{"id": 164, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract value significantly exceeds the limit fund, indicating possible irregularities or miscalculation. Although there were multiple bids and no single-bid flags, the winning supplier's high volume of contracts and substantial total earnings in comparison to the market may suggest a potential preference or undue advantage. However, the supplier's low cancellation rate points to reliable service execution."}
{"id": 165, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows a healthy level of competition with 16 bids submitted and no single bidder flags. However, the winning supplier has a relatively high contract win rate and a significant historical cancellation rate of 40%. These factors suggest potential reliability issues or strategic bidding practices, posing a moderate risk to integrity."}
{"id": 166, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract ratio between the winning bid and the limit fund is very high (0.98), suggesting limited competition, albeit there were five bids submitted. Importantly, only one bid was qualified, which raises concerns about the evaluation criteria or competitive environment. Additionally, the winning supplier has consistently secured contracts in 2025, but their lack of wins in single-bid procedures and zero historical cancellation rate adds a counterbalance to the risk assessment."}
{"id": 167, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process raises several red flags: there was only one bid submitted, and it was not qualified. The winning offer value is reported as zero, which is anomalous given the contract value. These factors, coupled with the single bidder situation, indicate a potentially non-competitive process, suggesting a high corruption/integrity risk."}
{"id": 168, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning bid closely matches the limit fund, suggesting potential precision in bidding. There is significant competition with 22 bids and 9 qualifying bids, reducing the risk. However, the supplier has a high number of wins in 2025 with a notable cancellation rate of 0.29, which could indicate potential reliability concerns. Overall, these factors suggest a medium risk."}
{"id": 169, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement has a low winning bid value compared to the limit fund, indicating potential cost efficiency. However, having only one qualified bidder out of five and the supplier winning the only contract they bid on in 2025 raises concerns about competition and impartiality. These factors suggest a medium risk level for integrity in this case."}
{"id": 170, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears to have been competitive, with four bids submitted and all qualified. However, the winning supplier's high volume of contracts awarded in one year and a significant historical cancellation rate indicate potential risks. The small gap between the winning bid and the limit fund suggests possible cost manipulation."}
{"id": 171, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case indicates a significant discrepancy between the limit fund and the winning offer value, raising concerns about the integrity of the process. Although many bids were submitted and no single bidder flags exist, the large overvaluation of the winning bid compared to the budgeted limit suggests potential manipulation or collusion."}
{"id": 172, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "While the winning bid is close to the limit fund, indicating a competitive offer, some risk factors exist. Only one bid was qualified despite three submissions, and the winner has a substantial number of total contracts, suggesting a strong market position that could potentially influence competition. The supplier's relatively low share in single-bid procedures and low historical cancellation rate help mitigate these concerns slightly."}
{"id": 173, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process was competitive with two bids, but only one qualified, suggesting potential issues in the qualification criteria or their interpretation. The winning supplier has won multiple contracts in a short period, raising concerns about possible favoritism. However, the lack of single-bid wins and a zero cancellation rate mitigate some risk factors."}
{"id": 174, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The process involved a competitive bidding environment with 12 qualified bids and no single bidder flags, which suggests a healthy level of competition. However, the winning supplier has a high cancellation rate of 1.00, which could indicate potential reliability or performance issues. Additionally, the supplier's consistent success in winning contracts might suggest preferential treatment, though the absence of single-bid wins mitigates this concern."}
{"id": 175, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement procedure shows a concerning aspect where only one bid was qualified out of three submitted, indicating potential barriers to competition. While the winning supplier has a history of winning multiple contracts and a perfect cancellation rate, the single qualified bidder flag raises an integrity risk that should be further investigated. The close winner-value to limit-fund ratio is reasonable but does not significantly offset these concerns."}
{"id": 176, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case exhibits a few indicators of concern: only two bids were submitted and only one was qualified, which can indicate limited competition. Additionally, the winning supplier has a high number of contracts in a single year, raising potential concerns about concentration. However, the low ratio of single-bid wins and a reasonable winner value suggest this risk is medium rather than high."}
{"id": 177, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The ratio of the winning offer to the limit fund is reasonably competitive at 0.89. The presence of 21 bids, with 11 qualified, indicates a competitive process. However, the winning supplier's nationwide high contract win rate in 2025 and a somewhat high historical cancellation rate of 0.26 suggest potential issues. Despite competitive elements, the cancellation rate elevates potential integrity concerns to a medium risk."}
{"id": 178, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive with six bids submitted and qualified, suggesting a fair level of market participation. The winning bid closely matches the limit fund, indicating no significant overpricing. The winning supplier has a 0% cancellation rate and a relatively low share of wins in single-bid procedures, further suggesting a low risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 179, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved multiple bids, indicating a competitive environment, and the winning offer was below the limit fund. However, only one bid was qualified, and the supplier has a high volume of contracts, which may suggest preferential treatment or lack of competition. Additionally, the supplier's cancellation rate is non-trivial, which warrants moderate concern."}
{"id": 180, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process appears competitive, with 5 bids submitted and qualified. However, the winning supplier has a high contract win history, suggesting potential favoritism. The supplier's 18% cancellation rate also raises concerns. Despite a competitive bid ratio, these factors indicate a medium level of integrity risk."}
{"id": 181, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process exhibits high corruption risk indicators: the absence of qualified bids despite an open procedure, leading to a winning offer value of 0.00, and the involvement of a single bidder who hasn't won any contracts in the relevant period. The lack of competition and transparency suggests potential integrity issues."}
{"id": 182, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The risk is considered medium because, although there was competition with three bids and no indicators of single bidding, the winning supplier has a high number of previous contract wins in the same year, suggesting a dominant market position. Additionally, the supplier has a high historical cancellation rate of 0.38, which could indicate reliability issues."}
{"id": 183, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case shows a perfect match between the winning bid and the limit fund, which could suggest potential budget manipulation. Despite a competitive bidding process with 22 submissions, only 3 were qualified, which could indicate restrictive qualification criteria. The winning supplier's historical cancellation rate of 0.16 is notably significant, suggesting potential performance issues in their contracts."}
{"id": 184, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement involves a small value service, and while there were three bids submitted, only one was qualified, suggesting limited competition. The winning supplier has a capped history of winning multiple contracts in 2025 but no record of single-bid successes or cancellations, indicating fair but potentially advantageous conditions. These factors suggest moderate risk."}
{"id": 185, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value significantly exceeds the limit fund, suggesting a potential for overpricing or miscalculation. Although there were multiple qualified bids, reducing concerns about bid rigging, the winning supplier has an extensive history of winning contracts, which could indicate preferential treatment. The historical cancellation rate is low, which slightly mitigates risk, but overall, the procurement exhibits signs of medium integrity risk."}
{"id": 186, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case presents a medium corruption risk due to the fact that only one bid was qualified despite eight being submitted. This could indicate issues in the selection criteria or transparency. However, the supplier’s historical performance is strong with no cancellations, and the competitive ratio of winning bid to limit fund supports fair pricing."}
{"id": 187, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a moderately competitive process with 29 bids submitted, of which 11 were qualified, indicating a lack of single-bid dominance. However, the winning supplier's high number of contracts in a single year suggests a potential risk of favoritism or over-reliance on a single supplier. Additionally, a historical cancellation rate of 0.44 raises concerns over the supplier's reliability."}
{"id": 188, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents a medium risk due to the winning supplier's significant number of contract wins in 2025, which could indicate preferential treatment, although this is mitigated by a competitive bidding process with multiple qualified bidders. The low cancellation rate and the ratio of the winning offer to the limit fund suggest reasonable management, but the supplier's 15% share in single-bid procedures necessitates vigilance to ensure fairness and competition."}
{"id": 189, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The ratio of the winner's offer to the limit fund is reasonable, indicating competitive pricing. There were 20 bids with no single-bid flags, suggesting a healthy level of competition. However, the winning supplier has a high historical cancellation rate of 0.57, which raises reliability concerns and potentially indicates systemic issues in past contract fulfillments."}
{"id": 190, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "While the process involved a competitive number of bids and a reasonable bid-to-fund ratio, the winning supplier's high contract win frequency and significant contract value indicate possible favoritism or familiarity bias. Additionally, the supplier's relatively high historical cancellation rate raises concerns about the fulfillment of procurement obligations."}
{"id": 191, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows competitive aspects with 14 bids submitted and no single bidder dominance, indicating integrity in selection. However, the winning supplier has a high number of contract wins in 2025 and a significant portion of these may be in non-competitive contexts, as suggested by a 0.48 cancellation rate, raising concerns about potential inefficiencies or underlying issues. The overall risk is medium, considering these mixed signals."}
{"id": 192, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning bid is almost equal to the limit fund, and the single qualified bidder flag indicates limited competition, which can be a risk indicator. However, the supplier has no history of winning single-bid contracts or cancellations, suggesting a generally reliable performance history. These factors balance to a medium risk level."}
{"id": 193, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procedure used was Small Value, which typically involves less scrutiny, increasing the potential risk. Despite receiving 5 bids, only 1 was qualified, and this bidder won the full contract value for the year, which could suggest potential issues in the bidding qualification process. However, the winning offer was significantly below the limit fund, and the supplier has no historical cancellation issues, which helps mitigate risk."}
{"id": 194, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved nine bids, with two being qualified, indicating a competitive environment. However, the close match between the winning offer and the limit fund (0.98 ratio) may suggest limited cost savings. Additionally, the winning supplier's substantial volume of contracts and moderate cancellation rate could pose risks of preferential treatment or systemic issues, despite the absence of single-bid distortions."}
{"id": 195, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process demonstrated competitive bidding with 4 bids submitted, but only one bid was qualified, indicating limited competition at the qualification stage. While the winning bid closely matched the limit fund and the bidder has a clean history with no cancellations, the repeated success of the supplier in winning multiple contracts suggests potential favoritism or lack of competition over time."}
{"id": 196, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer value appears significantly higher than the stated limit fund, suggesting possible errors or data misrepresentation. The supplier's frequent wins and high total contract value in a single year could indicate undue favoritism or lack of competition, despite a low share of single-bid wins. These factors collectively elevate the corruption risk profile."}
{"id": 197, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved an open simple procedure with a reasonable number of bids (3), but only one was qualified, indicating limited competition. The winning bidder's history of winning multiple contracts in the same year suggests competitive strength, but the lack of competition raises concerns. The supplier has a clean record with no history of cancellations, reducing integrity risks, but the high success rate in a competitive environment could indicate possible favoritism."}
{"id": 198, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning supplier has a significant number of contracts in 2025, which could indicate preferential treatment, especially given their relatively high contract value total. However, the competition was fair with 11 bids and multiple qualified bidders, reducing immediate concerns. The supplier's high cancellation rate is a potential integrity risk."}
{"id": 199, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The risk is medium due to several factors: the winning supplier has a significant number of contracts, suggesting market dominance, and a relatively high historical cancellation rate of 21%, indicating potential issues in fulfilling previous contracts. However, the open simple procedure and multiple qualified bids reduce the risk, balancing the overall assessment."}
{"id": 200, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement presents a high corruption risk due to several red flags: a single bidder with a 100% limit fund match, high frequency of wins (92%) in single-bid scenarios, and the supplier holding multiple contracts with significant total value. These factors suggest a lack of competition and potential favoritism."}
{"id": 201, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procedure has a limit fund of 0.00, yet the winning offer is valued at 52990.00, indicating potential inconsistencies or misreporting in budgeting. Additionally, the winning supplier has secured an unusually high number of contracts (443) within one year, with a total value of nearly 50 million, suggesting potential favoritism or lack of competition. These issues highlight significant integrity risks in the procurement process."}
{"id": 202, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The presence of a single bidder in a small value procurement with a winning offer of 0.00 raises significant concerns. The lack of competing bidders and the contract value being recorded as zero suggest a potential lack of competitive pressure and transparency, indicating a high corruption risk."}
{"id": 203, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows several red flags: the winning offer is 0.00, the limit fund is undefined (nan), and there were no bids submitted or qualified. Additionally, there is no bid history or awarded contracts for the winning supplier, indicating a lack of competition and transparency. These factors contribute to a high corruption and integrity risk."}
{"id": 204, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows several red flags: a winning offer value of 0.00, no bids submitted or qualified, and a lack of a specified limit fund. These factors suggest a non-transparent process, likely manual errors or deliberate manipulation. The absence of any historical data on the supplier's past contracts accentuates the risk level."}
{"id": 205, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case presents several red flags: the winning offer value is zero, the limit fund is not available, and no bids were qualified. Additionally, the absence of financial transactions or historical data for the winning supplier raises concerns about transparency and competition in the procurement process."}
{"id": 206, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents several red flags. The winning offer value is stated as 0.00, suggesting a potential error or misreporting. Additionally, the limit fund is 'nan', providing no clear benchmark for comparison. These anomalies, combined with the lack of historical winnings for the supplier, indicate a high risk of integrity issues or data inaccuracies."}
{"id": 207, "llm_label": "Low", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case involves a small value supply contract with no monetary value entered, but with a high number of bids (27), indicating competitive interest. All bids were qualified, and there is no indication of single-bid dominance. The history of the winning supplier shows no prior contracts or cancellations, suggesting no concerning patterns. These factors collectively suggest a low risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 208, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows several red flags for corruption risk: a winning offer of 0.00 and a ratio of NaN indicate possible data entry errors or manipulation. Additionally, there's only one bid submitted and no bids qualified, suggesting a lack of competitive bidding. The single bidder flag combined with these anomalies increases the concern for integrity issues."}
{"id": 209, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The significant red flags in this case include the lack of a specified limit fund, and the winning offer value being recorded as 0. This suggests potential inaccuracies or lack of transparency in procurement records, which is unusual and concerning. Additionally, despite 13 submitted bids, the winning bid details are not clear, raising questions about the integrity of the process."}
{"id": 210, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The single-bid situation raises a moderate risk of lack of competition, especially when the same supplier has a significant share (53%) in single-bid procedures. However, the winning bid is close to the limit fund and the supplier has a clean record with a 0.00 cancellation rate, mitigating some concerns. Therefore, the risk is assessed as medium."}
{"id": 211, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved a single bidder, which can be a risk factor for reduced competition. However, the winning offer was significantly below the limit fund, indicating potential cost-effectiveness. Also, the supplier has a low historical cancellation rate and a relatively low share of wins in single-bid procedures, which might mitigate some concerns."}
{"id": 212, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a high risk due to a single bid being submitted and qualified, indicating a lack of competition. Additionally, the winning supplier's high frequency of wins in single-bid procedures (58%) raises concerns about competitive fairness and potential favoritism."}
{"id": 213, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The absence of a limit fund and the winning offer value being 0.00 raises significant red flags for integrity. Additionally, despite having multiple qualified bids, the zero contract value with no historical data on the winning supplier suggests potential irregularities or errors in the procurement process."}
{"id": 214, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process exhibits a high corruption risk due to the presence of only a single bidder, which limits competition. The winning offer value of 0.00 compared to the set limit fund suggests potential issues such as misreporting or suspicious practices. The supplier has no previous wins or historical activity to assess credibility, further heightening the risk."}
{"id": 215, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procedure exhibits several red flags: the limit fund is set at 0.00, yet the winning offer is 63,000.00, creating unclear financial oversight. Furthermore, the notable contract-winning trend of the supplier (701 contracts in one year) suggests potential favoritism or non-transparent practices in public procurements. These factors collectively elevate the integrity risk of this procurement."}
{"id": 216, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process had multiple bidders, all of whom were qualified, indicating a competitive process. However, the lack of a specified limit fund raises concerns about budgetary transparency. Additionally, the winning supplier's high number of contract wins in a single year suggests a dominant market position, which could indicate potential favoritism or reduced competitiveness in the long term."}
{"id": 217, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The absence of a limit fund suggests a lack of budgetary control, which can create opportunities for inflated pricing. While three bids were submitted, indicating some level of competition, the winning supplier’s extensive prior success hints at possible favoritism, especially considering the high total value of their past contracts. However, the low cancellation rate mitigates some concerns, suggesting satisfactory performance."}
{"id": 218, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case shows several red flags: the winning offer value is 0.00, indicating a possible data entry or reporting issue. Additionally, there were 9 bids submitted but none were qualified, pointing to potential process irregularities. These anomalies, combined with the lack of limit fund and winner data, suggest a high risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 219, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case involves a high number of contracts won by a single supplier, which raises concerns about preferential treatment or lack of competitive bidding. However, the supplier's low cancellation rate and share of wins in single-bid procedures suggest a relatively stable and fair procurement environment. The notable discrepancy between the limit fund and the winning offer value further elevates the risk level."}
{"id": 220, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning supplier's dominance in the market, evidenced by 335 contracts in a single year, suggests strong influence which can indicate favoritism. However, the absence of single-bid procedures and a low cancellation rate partially mitigates risk, indicating fair competition among multiple bids."}
{"id": 221, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved multiple bidders and no single-bidder flags, indicating competitive bidding. However, the lack of a limit fund and the winning supplier's high volume of contracts in the same year suggest possible favoritism or over-reliance on this supplier. Additionally, the supplier's historical cancellation rate, though low, suggests some risk."}
{"id": 222, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved multiple bids and the supplier has a low cancellation rate, which are positive indicators. However, the contract was awarded despite a limit fund of 0.00, raising questions about compliance with financial regulations. The supplier's significant number of contract wins could indicate market dominance, which requires further scrutiny."}
{"id": 223, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procedure shows a discrepancy between the limit fund (0.00) and the winning offer (205000.00), creating an undefined financial ratio and suggesting potential irregularities in budget allocation. The winning supplier, having won 701 contracts in a single year with a total value far exceeding typical thresholds, may indicate a risk of preferential treatment or oligopolistic practices in procurement."}
{"id": 224, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows several signs of healthy competition with 6 bids, no single bidder dominance, and the successful bidder having a low historical cancellation rate. However, the unavailability of a limit fund and the prominent success of the supplier in terms of winning numerous contracts could suggest an environment where favorable conditions for certain suppliers might exist. This combination indicates a medium level of potential risk."}
{"id": 225, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contracting process used an open procedure with competitive bidding, which generally supports transparency and fairness. However, the winning bid matched the limit fund exactly, which can indicate potential tailoring or insider knowledge. Additionally, there was only one qualified bid out of two submitted, which raises concerns about limited competition. Given these factors, the overall risk is assessed as medium."}
{"id": 226, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The situation indicates potential procedural irregularities such as the lack of bids and unclear financial details, like a winning offer value of zero and an undefined limit fund. These irregularities suggest potential integrity risks, as they deviate significantly from standard procurement practices."}
{"id": 227, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a lack of critical information, such as the limit fund and a winning offer value of 0.00, which raises red flags. Additionally, all bids were disqualified, and there is no historical winning record for the supplier, suggesting potential process irregularities. The absence of qualified bids alongside a non-applicable winner value implies significant procedural and integrity risks."}
{"id": 228, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The absence of a limit fund, a winning offer value of 0, and no bids submitted indicates procedural irregularities, suggesting a high risk of corruption or integrity issues. Additionally, having 0 bids qualified and the related ratios as 'nan' raise concerns about the transparency and competitive nature of the process."}
{"id": 229, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows a high risk of corruption and integrity issues due to several red flags. The contract was awarded with a winning bid value of 0.00, despite the limit fund being 22,204,642.42, indicating potential irregularities. There was only one bid submitted and qualified, and the supplier has a high share (0.73) of wins in single-bid procedures. Such factors suggest a lack of competition and possible favoritism."}
{"id": 230, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows significant red flags: the winning offer value and number of bids are both zero, and there is no limit fund specified. Additionally, no bids were qualified, indicating irregularities in the bidding process, suggesting a high potential for corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 231, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case presents multiple red flags: 'nan' as a limit fund and '0.00' as the winning offer value suggest non-transparent or erroneous financial data. With a high number of bids (26) submitted and qualified, a winning bid of zero indicates potential data entry errors or manipulation. Additionally, the winning supplier's lack of previous contracts in 2025 raises questions about the supplier's experience and capacity, increasing the integrity risk."}
{"id": 232, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "There are potential integrity concerns due to the absence of a documented limit fund and a winning offer value significantly above zero. However, all five bids were qualified, and there is no indication of a single bidder scenario. The frequent winning of the supplier could suggest a competitive edge but might also hint at preferential treatment. The supplier's low share of wins in single-bid procedures and moderate historical cancellation rate contribute to a medium risk label."}
{"id": 233, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The significant discrepancy between the limit fund (0.00) and the winning offer value (42500.00) raises immediate red flags about the competitive fairness and integrity of the procurement process. Additionally, the winning supplier's high volume of contracts and dominance in past procurement activities, combined with their slightly elevated rate of cancellations, suggest a concerning level of undue influence and potential favoritism, indicating high corruption risk."}
{"id": 234, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved a fair level of competition with 7 bids submitted, indicating a potentially competitive environment. However, the contracting authority's limit fund for the procedure being 0.00, while the winning offer is significantly high, raises questions about financial clarity and budget alignment. Additionally, the winning supplier has a notable contract history, which might suggest familiarity but also poses a risk of favoritism if not properly justified. The supplier’s low cancellation rate suggests reliability, which moderates the overall risk assessment."}
{"id": 235, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process showed signs of limited competition with only one bid submitted and qualified, suggesting a lack of competitive bidding. Additionally, the winning supplier has an extremely high share (89%) of wins in single-bid procedures, which can indicate a recurring pattern of uncompetitive practices. The supplier's extensive history of contract wins further raises concerns about potential favoritism or monopolistic control within the procurement process."}
{"id": 236, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows some unusual elements that suggest a moderate risk. Although there were multiple bidders and a competitive process, the limit fund is set at zero, which is unconventional. The winning supplier has a significant history of winning contracts, raising concerns about market domination. However, the absence of single-bid dominance and a low cancellation rate mitigate the risk slightly."}
{"id": 237, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procedure attracted multiple bids and the winning supplier has a good track record with a low cancellation rate, indicating competitive bidding. However, the limit fund stated as 0.00 is unusual and raises potential red flags regarding budget estimation or transparency issues. Additionally, the supplier's extensive win history in the same year could suggest preferential treatment or market dominance."}
{"id": 238, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case exhibits several red flags indicative of high risk. The winning offer value is 0.00, which is highly unusual and suggests possible data entry errors or fraudulent reporting. Additionally, only one bid was submitted and qualified, indicating a lack of competition. The supplier has no previous contract wins in 2025, pointing to potential questions regarding their experience or capability."}
{"id": 239, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The case demonstrates a high corruption risk due to several red flags: there was only one bidder, the winning offer is valued at zero, and the supplier has no history of winning contracts or participating in bids in 2025. These factors suggest a lack of competitive procurement and potential manipulation or errors."}
{"id": 240, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The significant discrepancy between the limit fund and the winning offer value suggests a lack of transparency or incomplete data. The winning supplier has a high historical rate of contract cancellations at 20%, which may indicate performance issues. However, the competitive bidding process with six qualified bids mitigates the risk level to medium."}
{"id": 241, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The contract details indicate several red flags: the winning offer is 0.00 with a limit fund marked as nan, suggesting a potential data entry error or lack of transparency. No bids were qualified, and the winning supplier has no historical wins, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the process. These factors imply a significant risk of procedural and integrity issues."}
{"id": 242, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved competitive bidding with no single bidder, suggesting diversity in competition and potentially reducing corruption risk. However, a significant issue is the zero limit fund compared to the substantial winning offer, which can indicate budgetary manipulation or mismanagement. Additionally, the supplier's dominant market position with many contracts won in one year warrants closer scrutiny, despite a low historical cancellation rate."}
{"id": 243, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process had only one bid, which suggests a lack of competition that increases corruption risk. The winning supplier frequently wins single-bid contracts (58% of their contracts), indicating potential preferential treatment or barriers to entry for other bidders. Additionally, the supplier's significant market share in these types of procedures is concerning."}
{"id": 244, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents several red flags indicating high risk. The winning offer value is 0.00, which is unusual and suggests potential misreporting or manipulation. There was only one bid submitted, which could point to a lack of competition. Additionally, no bids were qualified, raising concerns about bidder eligibility and the fairness of the process."}
{"id": 245, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case exhibits several indicators of high risk. The absence of a limit fund and a winning offer value of 0.00 suggests potential inaccuracies or irregularities in financial reporting. Additionally, despite receiving ten bids, the winning supplier has no previous contract wins in 2025 and no historical data, raising concerns about the credibility of the supplier selection process."}
{"id": 246, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The contract's winning value significantly exceeds the specified limit fund, which was set to 0, raising potential concerns about the transparency and allocation of funds. Despite multiple bids being received and qualified, indicating competition, the frequent success of the winning supplier, with 443 contracts in a single year, suggests a potential risk of preferential treatment or inadequate competition."}
{"id": 247, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The limit fund for the procedure is set at 0.00, yet the winning offer is 59999.00, indicating a possible discrepancy in budget allocation. Additionally, the winning supplier has secured a significant number of contracts in a short time period with a relatively high historical cancellation rate of 0.12. These factors suggest heightened corruption or integrity risks."}
{"id": 248, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The significant deviation between the winning offer value and the limit fund indicates potential misalignment in budget estimation or irregularity in fund allocation. Additionally, the high number of contracts won by the supplier in 2025 suggests potential favoritism, although their low cancellation rate mitigates some risk. Overall, these factors contribute to a medium level of corruption/integrity risk."}
{"id": 249, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning bid amount is exactly equal to the limit fund, indicating potential precision in bidding. Only one bid was qualified out of four, raising concerns about the transparency of the evaluation process. Furthermore, the winning supplier, despite having no single-bid wins, has a relatively high contract cancellation rate of 0.28, suggesting potential performance issues."}
{"id": 250, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows signs of potential issues, indicated by a significant discrepancy between the limit fund and the winning offer value. Although competitive with seven bids and no single bidder dominance, the winning supplier's large volume of contracts and presence in single-bid procedures point towards possible undue influence or favoritism, though mitigated by their low cancellation rate."}
{"id": 251, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The lack of clear financial figures such as the limit fund and winning offer value raises red flags, as they are reported as 'nan' and '0.00' respectively. This lack of financial transparency coupled with zero value contracts awarded to the winning supplier suggests potential data integrity issues or misreporting, indicating a high integrity risk."}
{"id": 252, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case presents a high risk due to the absence of critical financial data, such as the limit fund and winning offer value, both indicated as 'nan'. Additionally, none of the four submitted bids were qualified, raising concerns about the competitive integrity of the process. The winning supplier's record shows no prior experience or contract value, further highlighting potential issues in procurement practices."}
{"id": 253, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The winning offer significantly exceeds the limit fund for the procedure, which suggests a possible oversight or error in the procurement planning. Additionally, the winning supplier's history of 173 contracts in one year raises concerns about market dominance, even though their low cancellation rate and no single-bid wins mitigate some of the risk. Overall, these factors indicate a medium level of integrity risk."}
{"id": 254, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The risk is high due to several red flags: the winning offer value is 0.00, indicating a potential reporting error or manipulation. Additionally, there was only one bid submitted and qualified, suggesting a lack of competition. The winning supplier's share in single-bid procedures is 100%, which may indicate preferential treatment or a lack of market interest."}
{"id": 255, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The contract was awarded through a single-bid process, which limits competition and can indicate favoritism or a lack of transparency. Additionally, the winning supplier has a significant history of winning contracts, increasing the potential risk of collusion or preferential treatment, despite having no historical cancellations. These factors collectively suggest a high level of corruption or integrity risk."}
{"id": 256, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows several red flags indicating high corruption risk: no bids were submitted, and the winning offer and contract values are listed as zero, which is unusual. Furthermore, the lack of financial information for the limit fund and issues with single-bid procedures suggest procedural irregularities or data errors that require further investigation."}
{"id": 257, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The risk is high due to a combination of factors: the high ratio of winning offer value to the limit fund (0.99), the presence of a single bid, and the supplier's domination in single-bid procedures with a 0.95 share. Moreover, the supplier's extensive history of winning contracts may indicate a lack of competition or favoritism."}
{"id": 258, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The absence of a limit fund and the winning offer value of 0.00, combined with the presence of 16 qualified bidders and a zero historical record for the winning supplier, suggests irregularities. These factors indicate a high potential for data errors or manipulation, which poses a significant integrity risk."}
{"id": 259, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement summary indicates several red flags. The winning offer value is 0.00, and no bids were submitted or qualified. There is a lack of competition, with a single bidder and no limit fund specified, which raises concerns about transparency and fair market value. These factors suggest a high risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 260, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved multiple bids with no indication of single-bid dominance. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the limit fund (0.00) and the winning offer value (16790.00), which raises concerns about transparency and budget accuracy. Additionally, the winning supplier has an extensive history of contract awards, which might suggest market concentration, potentially increasing the corruption risk."}
{"id": 261, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows several red flags: the winning offer value is listed as 0.00, the ratio of winner value to limit fund is undefined (nan), and no bids were qualified. Furthermore, the winning supplier has no history of winning contracts in 2025, indicating potential inexperience or irregularities. These factors cumulatively suggest a high corruption or integrity risk."}
{"id": 262, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "There is a high corruption risk indicated by several factors: the presence of only one bidder in a competitive open procedure, suggesting possible lack of competition or collusion. The winning supplier's frequent success in single-bid procedures further raises concerns about reduced competition. Although the supplier's historical cancellation rate is low, the pattern of contract awards still suggests potential for non-competitive practices."}
{"id": 263, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows signs of high risk due to the fact that there was only a single bidder, who has a high share of wins in single-bid procedures. This pattern could suggest a lack of competition and possible preferential treatment. Additionally, the significant difference between the limit fund and the winning offer value raises questions about transparency and potential manipulation."}
{"id": 264, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process shows a significant discrepancy in the limit fund value of 0.00 and the winning offer of 24000.00, suggesting potential irregularities. Additionally, the winning supplier has an exceptionally high number of contracts won in a single year, which may indicate preferential treatment. These factors, along with the unusual absence of a defined limit fund, raise substantial concerns about the integrity of the procurement process."}
{"id": 265, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "While there is a relatively high volume and value of contracts awarded to the supplier, no single-bid procedures are indicated, suggesting healthy competition. However, the limit fund set to 0.00 raises concerns about potential process irregularities or misreporting in fund allocation. The historical cancellation rate of 0.04 is low, reducing risk slightly, but the unusual fund reporting necessitates caution."}
{"id": 266, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows signs of high risk due to the presence of a single bid and a winning supplier with a dominant share of wins in single-bid procedures (96%). Such dominance can indicate a lack of competition. Additionally, the bid value being nearly equal to the limit fund suggests potential collusion. The supplier's high contract win rate in the year raises further red flags about the fairness or integrity of the process."}
{"id": 267, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involves a negotiated procedure without notice with zero winning offer value, which is unusual and suggests a lack of transparency. Additionally, there was only one bid submitted and qualified, indicating a lack of competition. These factors combined suggest a high risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 268, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved a competitive bidding with 6 qualified bids and no single bidder dominance, which is a positive aspect. However, the limit fund for the procedure is set at 0.00, creating an unclear budgetary framework. Additionally, the winning supplier's large volume of contract wins raises concerns about potential supplier favoritism or an excessively dominant market position."}
{"id": 269, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The integrity risk is high due to several red flags: there is a single bidder and single qualified bidder, suggesting a lack of competition. Additionally, the contract’s winning value is significantly high with a zero limit fund, indicating possible misrepresentation of budget limits. The winning supplier's disproportionate amount of wins, combined with a low cancellation rate, suggests potential manipulation or preferential treatment in award processes."}
{"id": 270, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procedure type 'Negotiated without Notice' and a single bid submitted are significant red flags, pointing to potential lack of competition. The winning supplier has a 50% share in single-bid wins, suggesting possible favoritism or monopolistic practices. Despite a perfect historical cancellation rate, these factors combined indicate a high risk of integrity issues."}
{"id": 271, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows a high risk due to several indicators: there was only one bid submitted and qualified, indicating no competition. The winning supplier has a substantial share of wins in single-bid procedures (0.33), suggesting possible preferential treatment or lack of competition. The high ratio of winner value to limit fund (0.98) further implies minimal cost savings. Such patterns can indicate higher corruption or integrity risks."}
{"id": 272, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement has several concerning elements, including the limit fund being set to 0.00, which is unusual and non-standard, raising questions about proper budgeting and planning. Additionally, the winning supplier has won an unusually high number of contracts (339) in one year, which could indicate preferential treatment or lack of competition. Although there are multiple qualified bids, the irregularities present elevate the integrity risk."}
{"id": 273, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The risk is classified as High due to the absence of a limit fund and a winning offer value, making it impossible to assess the financial scope and fairness. Additionally, all submitted bids were qualified without clear criteria, and the entire process lacks transparency. The supplier's previous lack of winning contracts and minimal engagement raises concerns about their capability and the bidding process's integrity."}
{"id": 274, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement summary indicates several red flags: there were no submitted or qualified bids, yet the winning offer value is recorded as 0.00. Additionally, the limit fund is undefined, and the winning supplier has no prior contract wins or experience, which suggests potential procedural irregularities or data issues. These factors collectively suggest a high corruption or integrity risk."}
{"id": 275, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved a reasonable number of bids (6), indicating competitive interest, and no single-bid flags were raised. However, the discrepancy between the limit fund of 0.00 and the winning bid value suggests a potential issue with budget planning or transparency in the procurement process. Additionally, while the winning supplier frequently secures contracts, their historical cancellation rate is relatively low, mitigating some concerns."}
{"id": 276, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process displayed several red flags: there was only one bid submitted, which was also the only qualified bid. The winning bid value is 0.00 against a limit fund of 433330.00, indicating potential issues with financial transparency or reporting errors. Additionally, the same supplier won contracts under similar circumstances, raising concerns of lack of competition and potential favoritism."}
{"id": 277, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case shows several concerning anomalies: the winning offer value is 0.00, there were 0 bids submitted, and the limit fund is not available. These irregularities suggest a lack of transparency and competitive bidding, indicating a high risk of corruption or integrity issues."}
{"id": 278, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process indicates a potential integrity risk due to the single bidder situation and the winning supplier's significant share of wins in single-bid procedures (46%). Although the bid is well below the limit fund, the supplier's frequent success in similar contexts raises concerns. Additionally, their historical cancellation rate of 12% might indicate potential performance issues."}
{"id": 279, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement presents several red flags: the key financial values are all 'nan' or zero, implying potential data inconsistencies. Additionally, no bids were qualified out of ten submitted, suggesting possible procedural issues. The complete lack of contract value and a historical pattern of zero contracts heighten the integrity risk."}
{"id": 280, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement process involved multiple bids and no single-bidder incidents, which is positive. However, the significant difference between the winning offer value and the limit fund raises concerns about budget transparency. Additionally, the supplier's significant number of contracts won in 2025 suggests a potential over-reliance, which could indicate biases or favoritism, thereby elevating the risk to a Medium level."}
{"id": 281, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement involves a scenario with zero bids submitted and zero qualified bidders, resulting in an unsuccessful tender. The absence of a winning bid and the lack of competition suggest significant issues in the procurement process, raising integrity concerns. The procurement's status, combined with the lack of information on financial limits and values, further adds to the risk level."}
{"id": 282, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows significant risk due to the presence of only one bidder, who has a very high success rate in single-bid procedures (92%). This suggests limited competition and potential favoritism. Additionally, the supplier has secured a high number of contracts with substantial total value, raising concerns about monopolistic practices."}
{"id": 283, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement has unusual features: the limit fund and winning offer value are indicated as 'nan' and '0.00', respectively, and no bids were qualified. This raises concerns about transparency and bidding process integrity. These anomalies suggest a high risk of corruption or mismanagement."}
{"id": 284, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case exhibits several red flags: no bids were received, yet a winning offer is recorded at 0.00. Moreover, there is no disclosed limit fund, leaving comparison metrics undefined. These anomalies suggest potential integrity risks, warranting a high risk classification."}
{"id": 285, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The case exhibits several potential indicators of risk. The limit fund for this procedure is listed as 0.00, which is unusual and can point towards a lack of transparency in financial expectations. Additionally, the supplier has won a significant number of contracts within the year, suggesting possible favoritism, although their share of wins in single-bid procedures remains low. The historical cancellation rate is also minimally concerning at 3%, indicating some procedural issues but not decisively high."}
{"id": 286, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement details reveal several anomalies: the winning offer value is 0.00, and the limit fund is 'nan', indicating data discrepancies or omissions. Additionally, all 24 bids being qualified without any disqualifications might suggest lack of stringent evaluation criteria. These factors, combined with a zero value winning contract, point towards significant irregularities, suggesting a high corruption or integrity risk."}
{"id": 287, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The presence of a limit fund of 0.00 raises concerns about transparency in budgetary planning and execution. However, the competitive nature of the bidding process, with four bids submitted and no single bidder flags, reduces the risk level. The winning supplier's small share of single-bid contracts and low cancellation rate further suggest a competitive and reliable procurement process."}
{"id": 288, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows potential concerns as the limit fund is listed as 0.00, creating a misleading ratio and indicating unclear budgeting practices. However, the competitive bidding environment alleviates severe concerns, with 7 bids submitted. The historical cancellation rate of 0.12 for the winning supplier suggests some reliability issues, warranting a medium risk classification."}
{"id": 289, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement case demonstrates high risk due to the single bid submitted equalling the limit fund precisely. The winning supplier has a significant history of winning contracts, raising concerns about competitive fairness. Additionally, the supplier's share of wins in single-bid procedures is notable, further indicating potential issues with competitive practices."}
{"id": 290, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement summary indicates multiple red flags: the winning offer value is 0.00, which is highly unusual; no bids were qualified despite two submissions, suggesting potential procedural irregularities; and the winning supplier has no prior contracts, suggesting lack of experience.

{"id": 292, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The winning bid exceeds the limit fund, which raises concerns about financial management. Additionally, the supplier has a high historical contract cancellation rate of 0.38, suggesting reliability issues. Despite having only one qualified bidder, the supplier has won a significant number of contracts, possibly indicating a lack of competition or favoritism in procurement."}
{"id": 293, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The risk is classified as High due to multiple red flags: the winning bid value is notably zero, which is suspicious. Furthermore, there was only a single bidder who was also the winner, suggesting a lack of competition. The supplier has won all contracts in single-bid scenarios, indicating potentially unfair practices or favoritism in awarding contracts."}
{"id": 294, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The contracting authority set a limit fund of 0.00, which is inexplicably low and may suggest an oversight or deliberate undervaluation. The winning offer is significantly high compared to the limit fund. Additionally, the winning supplier's vast experience with 53 contracts in a single year may indicate a potential influence over the procurement process. These factors suggest a high corruption risk."}
{"id": 295, "llm_label": "High", "llm_explanation": "The procurement shows significant red flags: a single bidder with a 100% win rate in single-bid procedures, and a winning offer value of 0.00, indicating either a recording error or potential bid manipulation.

{"id": 298, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The risk is elevated due to the limit fund for the procedure being set to 0.00, which heavily skews the winner_value/limit_fund ratio. However, transparency is enhanced by a competitive process with five qualified bids. The winning supplier is experienced with a low cancellation rate, but their high volume of past contracts could suggest favoritism."}
{"id": 299, "llm_label": "Medium", "llm_explanation": "The main concern is the discrepancy between the specified limit fund of 0.00 and the winning bid of 71,500.00, suggesting possible oversight or error in budgeting procedures. However, the competition was open with three qualified bids, and the winning supplier has a low historical cancellation rate, which suggests reliability and mitigates some risk."}
